# Leetcode - 509. Fibonacci Number

## Algorithm

- Recursive

1. Set the end condition, which are fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1

2. call the function fib recursively.

- Dynamic programming

To adviod compute same fib number for many times, as the pic shown above, we may use dynamic programming.

1. create a reference map to store the fib number that we've calculted

2. assagin the default value, which fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1

3. caculate all the resulte starting from 2 until n

## Solution

```python
# Recursive
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return self.fib(n-1) + self.fib(n-2)


# Dynamic programming
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        fib_map = [0] * (n + 1) if n else [0] * 2
        fib_map[0] = 0
        fib_map[1] = 1

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            fib_map[i] = fib_map[i - 2] + fib_map[i - 1]
        return fib_map[n]

class Solution2:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2:
            return n

        prev1 = 0
        prev2 = 1
        curr = 0

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            curr = prev1 + prev2
            prev1 = prev2
            prev2 = curr
        return result
```

## Complexity

- Recursive

  - Time: O(2^n). From the gragh shown below, we can know that as the depth aprroaches to `n`, time complexity grows exponatially.

  - Space: O(n). Stack is used to keep track on calling the funtion `fib`.

- Dynamic Programming

  - Time: O(n). This approach reduces time complexity to O(n) because we only compute the value from 2 to n, one time for each number.

  - Space: O(n). We need a map length as big as the input `n` to store the outcome.

- Dynamic Programming 2

  - Time: O(n)

  - Space: O(1). Since we use 3 variables to store the computed values, this reduce space to O(1).
