# Leetcode - [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

## Algorithm

I. Brute force: it costs o(n^2) time to compute all substrings and o(n) time to varify if it is a palindrome. Therefore, the time complexity would be o(n^3) (pronounce as `n cube`).

II. Dynamic programming: it would reduce time complexity to o(n^2) but increases space complexity to o(n^2) since it uses o(n^2) space to store the table.

**III. Expanding around center: since there are only 2n-1 palindrome centers, including one center like `aba` and two centers like `abba`, we could solve it in o(n^2) time using constant space.**

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        result = ''

        for i in range(n):
            # one center
            start, end = i, i
            while start >= 0 and end < n and s[start] == s[end]:
                if (end - start + 1) > len(result):
                    result = s[start:end + 1]
                start -= 1
                end += 1

            # two centers
            start, end = i, i + 1
            while start >= 0 and end < n and s[start] == s[end]:
                if (end - start + 1) > len(result):
                    result = s[start:end + 1]
                start -= 1
                end += 1

        return result
```

## Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)

- Space: O(1)
