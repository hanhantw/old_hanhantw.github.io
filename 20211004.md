# Leetcode - [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

## Strategy

1. sort the intervals by the `start` value.

2. a list `result` to save merged intervals and the default value is the first item of the intervals

3. iterate through the intervals and see if the current interval should be merge with the previous interval in the result by the following rules:
    if the current interval begins after the previous interval, then they don't overlap, so we can appen the current interval into `result`;
    otherwise, we update the `end` value of the previous interval if it is smaller than the `end` value of current interval.
 
## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # O(nlogn)
        result = [intervals[0]]
        
        for start, end in intervals:
            start0 = result[-1][0]
            end0 = result[-1][1]
            # no overlap 
            if end0 < start:
                result.append([start, end])
            else:
            # has overlap
                result[-1][1] = max(end0, end)
        return result
                
```
