# Leetcode - 207

## Algorithm

1. loop the course list and make a list for its relationship that we can know which course is a prerequisite for what other courses, like `[[1, 2], [3], [3], []]`

2. use a list to mark each node's status. -1: not visited, 0: visiting, 1: finishing visited.

3. do depth-first search until finiish visiting all nodes.

4. if we found no cycle, that means we can finish all courses, so we will return true. Otherwise, return false.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        status = [-1] * numCourses

        for c1, c0 in prerequisites:
            graph[c0].append(c1)

        for vertex in range(numCourses):
            # if status[vertex] == 1:
            #     return False
            dfs(vertex)
            # if not dfs(vertex):
                # return False

        def dfs(vertex: int) -> bool:
            if status[vertex] > 0:
                # finish visiting
                return False
            status[vertex] = 0
            for child in graph[vertex]:
                dfs(child)
            status[vertex] = 1
            return True
```
